Language Modelling and Text Generation using LSTMs
With the latest developments and improvements in the field of deep learning and artificial intelligence, 
many exacting tasks of Natural Language Processing are becoming facile to implement and execute. 
Text Generation is one such task which can be be architectured using deep learning models, particularly Recurrent Neural Networks.
Text Generation is a type of Language Modelling problem. 
Language Modelling is the core problem for a number of of natural language processing tasks such as speech to text, conversational system, and text summarization. 
A trained language model learns the likelihood of occurrence of a word based on the previous sequence of words used in the text. 
Language models can be operated at character level, n-gram level, sentence level or even paragraph level.
